The analysis below focuses on the game called "Heroes of Pymoli Fantasy".

Similar to other game genres, this game is free-to-play. However, players are encouraged to purchase optional items that boots their overall gaming adventures. As part of the initial task, the company requires the data analyst to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into signficant and relevant insights.

## The final report includes the following categories, indicated below:

1) Player Count

2) Total Number of Players Purchasing Analysis 

3) Number of Unique Items Average Purchase Price

4) Total Number of Purchases Total Revenue Gender Demographics

## Percentage and Count of Male Players Percentage and Count of Female Players Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

The other categories are broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.) Purchase Count Average Purchase Price Total Purchase Value Normalized Totals

## Final Observations:

Out of all 576 active players, the most active players are male: compromising 84%. A smaller portion of female players exist at 14%.

The peak age demographic is between ages 20-24 at 44.8%. The secondary groups consists of teenagers between ages 15-19 at 18.6% and lastly, ages 25-29 at 13.4%.

## There are three items noted on the Top 5 rankings for both Most Popular and Most Profitable metrics:

1) The items 'Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm' had 12 purchases and total sales of $50.76.

2) Nirvana achieved 9 total purchases with total sales of $44.10.

3) Fiery Glass Crusader had 9 purchases with total sales of $41.22.

There could have been more sales if the games had more options catered to female players. On the 'Average Purchase Per Person' column, female players are at $4.47.


Interestingly, despite having less options for female players the Average Purchase per Person data among female players is slightly higher compared to the male players at $4.07.

The difference between the genders is 40 cents, which is approximately 10% more than male players.
